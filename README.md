Hi, I’m Will Hopper
I’m interested in data science and software engineering.
I’m currently expanding my knowledge of SQL and Python (pandas, numpy). I eventually want to explore Java, full stack engineering, and machine learning in Python. 
I’m looking to showcase my technical skills and learn how to become a better programmer and data analyst.
You can reach me through email at williamhopper7@gmail.com
Thank you!
